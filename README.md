### Using the K-mean clustering algorithm and Gaussian Mixture (GM) model to cluster the points in the Power Curve.
* SCADA data from Wind Turbine Generators.
* Data set from EDP.
* Unsupervised learning problem - Clustering

# [Regression - KNN regressor surrogate load model for Blade Flapwise Moment.](https://github.com/GonMazzini/Reliability-Analysis)
* KNN model with Cross-Validation (5 folds) in order to find the optimum value of K.
* With the model output, a Python implementation for First Order Reliability Method (FORM) and Monte Carlo as well.
